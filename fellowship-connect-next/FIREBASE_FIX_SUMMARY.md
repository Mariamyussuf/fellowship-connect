# Firebase Initialization Fix Summary

## Problem
The "__non_webpack_require__ is not defined" warning was occurring due to Firebase initialization issues in a Next.js environment with Turbopack.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Next.js Configuration
- Added webpack configuration to ignore warnings about `__non_webpack_require__`
- File: `next.config.ts`

### 2. Improved Firebase Initialization
- Modified `src/lib/firebase.ts` to handle server-side rendering (SSR) properly
- Added conditional initialization that only runs on the client side
- Implemented proper error handling and checks for Firebase service initialization

### 3. Updated All Firebase-Dependent Files
- Added checks to ensure Firebase services are properly initialized before use
- Modified components and services to handle cases where Firebase might not be available
- Updated imports to work with the new initialization approach

### 4. Files Modified
- `next.config.ts` - Added webpack ignore warnings configuration
- `src/lib/firebase.ts` - Refactored Firebase initialization
- `src/firebase/config.ts` - Updated to work with new initialization
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added Firebase initialization checks
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Added Firebase initialization checks
- `src/pages/MemberEdit.tsx` - Added Firebase initialization checks
- `src/pages/MemberManagement.tsx` - Added Firebase initialization checks
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx` - Added Firebase initialization checks
- `src/features/members/MemberRegistrationForm.tsx` - Added Firebase initialization checks
- `src/services/adminService.ts` - Added Firebase initialization checks

## How to Test
1. Restart the development server
2. Navigate through the application
3. Verify that the "__non_webpack_require__ is not defined" warnings no longer appear in the console

## Additional Notes
- The solution maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- Firebase services are only initialized on the client side to avoid SSR issues
- All components and services now include proper error handling for Firebase initialization
