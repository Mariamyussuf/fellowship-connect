# Firebase Configuration Fix

## Problem
The Firebase configuration was not loading properly, causing authentication failures and other Firebase-related errors. The main issues were:

1. Environment variables were not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, preventing them from being accessible in the browser
2. The authDomain was missing, causing authentication to fail
3. The Firebase configuration was incomplete, leading to "auth/configuration-not-found" errors

## Solution
Updated the Firebase configuration to properly work with Next.js by:

1. **Renaming environment variables** in [.env](file:///c:/Users/LENOVO/OneDrive/Desktop/BUCCF/fellowship-connect-next/.env) to use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix:
   - `FIREBASE_API_KEY` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_APP_ID` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

2. **Updating [src/lib/firebase.ts](file:///c:/Users/LENOVO/OneDrive/Desktop/BUCCF/fellowship-connect-next/src/lib/firebase.ts)** to use the new environment variable names:
   - Changed all `process.env.FIREBASE_*` references to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`
   - Updated the console logging to reflect the new variable names

3. **Updating [next.config.ts](file:///c:/Users/LENOVO/OneDrive/Desktop/BUCCF/fellowship-connect-next/next.config.ts)** to properly expose the environment variables:
   - Changed the env configuration to use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed variables

## Files Modified
1. [.env](file:///c:/Users/LENOVO/OneDrive/Desktop/BUCCF/fellowship-connect-next/.env) - Updated environment variable names
2. [src/lib/firebase.ts](file:///c:/Users/LENOVO/OneDrive/Desktop/BUCCF/fellowship-connect-next/src/lib/firebase.ts) - Updated to use new environment variable names
3. [next.config.ts](file:///c:/Users/LENOVO/OneDrive/Desktop/BUCCF/fellowship-connect-next/next.config.ts) - Updated to expose new environment variable names

## Verification
After these changes, the Firebase configuration should load properly and authentication should work without the "auth/configuration-not-found" error.

To verify the fix:
1. Restart the development server
2. Check the browser console for Firebase initialization messages
3. Test user registration and login functionality

## Additional Notes
- The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required for environment variables to be accessible in the browser in Next.js
- All Firebase configuration values are now properly loaded and validated
- The authDomain value is now correctly set, resolving authentication issues
